      "message": "Nested is apparently only supposed to be used with [binary states](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:packages/modules/StatsD/statsd/src/state/StateTracker.cpp?q\u003d%22Nested%20counting%20is%20only%20allowed%20for%20binary%20state%20events%22) so we probably also need to check if the state is binary. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a way to check if a state enum has only 2 values inside LogEvent/FieldValue. Although we already have state atoms with more than 2 states that also use nested\u003dtrue. We should have stronger enforcement on this probably.\n\nWith this change and the statsd change to not set nested\u003dtrue by default, we\u0027d get wrong nested value from devices that don\u0027t have the updated logging but have the updated statsd module. That intersection of devices should presumably be very low given this atom is logged from Wifi module which is updatable since R.",

      "message": "I just worry a bit about silently changing behavior behind the scenes. You\u0027re right that statsd can\u0027t know if it is a binary state beforehand. This would also change behavior for all states that dont explicitly specify nested that aren\u0027t binary, right? This should be an improvement for them, but do you know how many atoms fall into that case?\n\nShared a link offline, but I don\u0027t think we can assume that the intersection you\u0027re describing will be very low.\n\nNot totally sure what the decision should be, since I do agree that a default value of false always likely best - lets sync over chat/in the office brielfy?",
