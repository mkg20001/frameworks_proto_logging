      "message": "Adding new values generally LGTM except I think one of them should be renamed (see inline).\n\nIt looks like this CL is incorrect because it is removing a constant which code depends on:\n\npackages/modules/NetworkStack/src/android/net/ip/IpReachabilityMonitor.java:413: error: cannot find symbol\n            logNudFailed(event, NudEventType.NUD_MAC_ADDRESS_CHANGED);\n\nIf you want to rename the constant (which seems reasonable, assuming it\u0027s allowed), then I would suggest putting this CL in a topic with a NetworkStack CL that *only* renames the enum in NetworkStack code and makes no other changes. That will make it easier to review and submit the CL.",
