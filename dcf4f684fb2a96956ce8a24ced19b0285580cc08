      "message": "Feel free to submit so we have consistency, but is the filegroup needed? Sorry if I asked this before. Is it to mimic the changes to the enums? If it isn\u0027t needed, directly adding the files to the toplevel Android.bp saves a lot of these Android.bp files and makes things simpler. Looking at ag/19905054, only a few needed separate filegroups. I\u0027m not sure why, maybe it\u0027s only directories that already had android.bps?",
